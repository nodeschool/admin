# Adds chapter　information to a repository

At nodeschool every chapter has a repo on github. You can become a
chapter-maintainer by signing up for it
[here](https://github.com/nodeschool/organizers#how-to-start-a-new-nodeschool-chapter).

After you have the repo this wizard guides you to add all the information
necessary for your chapter.
